## Orders
Where a relationship between 2 objects is less than or equal to (<=)
It is a category because it is:
- Composition (a <= b, b <= c so a <= c)
- has id (because it is equal to itself)
This is called a *preorder*

if a <= b and b <= a then they are equal, this is called a partial order
